# Hello World!

Hello, and welcome to my personal rice configuration collection. Feel free to
explore this little organization I created to help store my rice configurations
in one place. Everything stored here is open to the public, and can be utilized
for personal use. However, I _highly_ recommend that you look through the code
of any configuration you plan on using or copying. Whatever works for me, may
not work for you!
